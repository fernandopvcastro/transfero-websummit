# Dev tools

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or yarn
```

In order to run it in development, run:

```bash
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

In order to do a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build # yarn build
```

There are two more scripts:

`preview` and `https-preview`

- `preview` command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from `dist` folder. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
- `https-preview` is the same, but with HTTPS. It's handy for testing your PWA capabilities in your local environment.
